This file contains the errors faced through differetn stages of development and their fixes

#VERSION 1: Main Menu

Issues with menu navigation:
    Problem: The program would occasionally crash if i tried to return back to the main menu from the customer details screen
    Solution: Added error handling to manage navigation transitions and ensure the program returns to the main menu smoothly.


#VERSION2 : Customer Details:
 Issue with data storage:
     Problem: Initially the program did not correctly store user information for later use
     Solution: introduced a dictionary to store customer information and ensure it can be accessed throughout the order process.


#VERSION 3: Adding bean varieties
 1. Issues with bean selection list:
     Problem: The bean selection list was not displaying correctly and was clusterred , causing confusion.
     Solution: Reformatted the list to clearly show each bean type and its roast options, ensuring better user experience.
2.  Issues with data handling:
    1. Problem: Incorrect data handling led to some selected beans not being recorded.
     Solution: 
       Step1:  Created a nested dictionary structure to store each bean type with its selected roast level.
       Step2: Implemented validation to ensure only valid selections are stored.
       Step3: Modified the code to append each selected bean and roast option to the customer's order list, ensuring all selections are captured and stored correctly.
    2. Problem: user could add more than 5 kg of beans
       Solution: Implemented validation checks to restrict the total quantity to a maximum of 5 kg.


#VERSION 4: order summary 
  1. Issues with display formatting:
     Problem: The summary display was cluttered and difficult to read because it collected all details into a single string without proper formatting.
     Solution: Introduced line breaks and clear labels for each section (customer information, bean orders) to enhance readability. Used `\n` to create new lines for each piece of information.
 2. Bean Order Details:
     Problem: he summary was missing some details about the beans, such as the roast level and whether they should be ground.
     Solution: Modified the data structure used to store bean orders to include all necessary attributes (bean type, roast level, quantity, grind option). Updated the summary generation code to extract and display these attributes correctly.


#VERSION 5: complete functionality
